## Architecture

WaspitoPlus follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:

- **Models:** Define the structure for users, doctors, prescriptions, obstacles, and app states.
- **ViewModels:** Handle business logic, data management, and state updates.
- **Views:** SwiftUI interfaces that bind to ViewModels for real-time updates.
- **Offline Handling:** Core Data and local storage ensure offline functionality.
